Title: Describing current trend in tax reporting

1.What is the problem you want to solve?

Historically, taxes has become to be known as something that is convuluted and very troublesome to do. As  arsult people have come to use tax professionals from corportations(HR Block/etc) or local professionals to naviagte the tax realm for them. With the rise of the personal computer and the internet, there are more sources than ever to help individuals self-report their taxes.Along with that rise, are a new crop of tech-litterature population and tax preparation software. It would only make sense that as time progressed the trend would be thta more individuals would opt to self-prepare taxes, I want toperform descriprtive analysis and see if the IRS data confirms this trend. With the data I hope to evaluate which populations are turning to self-reporting tax information(market trends) to the IRS and signal out what populations tax prepearers should market to.

2.Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

Tax professionals and tax prep software developers would be most interested in my data as this concerns them the most. Based off my analysis, I hope that these groups will be better able to target populations that would be most interested in using their services. For professionals whose income comes primarality filing other people taxes, they would consider______. For people thinkings about becoming tax professionals this would help them decide wheter the job market is right for them.

3.What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data

I will be using yearly data from the IRS that details how people are reporting their data(w/ or w/o help ,by income ranges, by state).https://www.irs.gov/statistics I will be also using the public sales data from intuit and other tax prep software developers to analyze trends.The data is made publically avaliable for investors. https://investors.intuit.com/Financial-Info/Annual-Reports/default.aspx
